Elastic Distances
=================

Distance measures that perform a non-linear mapping to align the time series and allow flexible comparison of one-to-many or one-to-none points (e.g., Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence). These measures produce elastic adjustment to compensate for potential localized misalignment.
