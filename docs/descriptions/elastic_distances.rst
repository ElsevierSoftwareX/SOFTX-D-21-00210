Elastic Distances
=================

Distance measures that perform a non-linear mapping to align the time series and allow flexible comparison of one-to-many or one-to-none points (e.g., Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence). These measures produce elastic adjustment to compensate for potential localized misalignment.

Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED)
******************************
TWED has been used in time series classification assessing classification performance while varying TWED input parameters [1, 2]. In the example, we calculate TWED between two time series varying its parameters.
